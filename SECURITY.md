# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following versions of our project are currently supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |

| < 4.0   | :x:                |

Versions 5.0.x and below 4.0 are no longer supported due to significant changes in the codebase and the introduction of new features that are not backward compatible.
